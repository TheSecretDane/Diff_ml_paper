  abstract = {Stochastic volatility models are increasingly important in practical derivatives pricing applications, yet relatively little work has been undertaken in the development of practical Monte Carlo simulation methods for this class of models. This paper considers several new algorithms for time-discretization and Monte Carlo simulation of Heston-type stochastic volatility models. The algorithms are based on a careful analysis of the properties of affine stochastic volatility diffusions, and are straightforward and quick to implement and execute. Tests on realistic model parameterizations reveal that the computational efficiency and robustness of the simulation schemes proposed in the paper compare very favorably to existing methods.},

The deep learning network is trained with eight input hyperparameters and three hidden layers, and evaluated using mean squared error, correlation coefficient, coefficient of determination, and computation time. The generation of data was accomplished through the use of Monte Carlo simulation, employing variance reduction techniques. The results demonstrate that deep learning is an accurate and efficient tool for option pricing, particularly under challenging pricing models like Heston and Bates, which lack a closed-form solution.

Discretization methods can be used for simulating security prices under these models. However, discretization introduces bias into the simulation results, and a large number of time steps may be needed to reduce the discretization bias to an acceptable level. This paper suggests a method for the exact simulation of the stock price and variance under Heston's stochastic volatility model and other affine jump diffusion processes. The sample stock price and variance from the exact distribution can then be used to generate an unbiased estimator of the price of a derivative security. We compare our method with the more conventional Euler discretization method and demonstrate the faster convergence rate of the error in our method. Specifically, our method achieves an O(s               -1/2               ) convergence rate, where s is the total computational budget. The convergence rate for the Euler discretization method is O(s               -1/3               ) or slower, depending on the model coefficients and option payoff function.},

The simulation method that we study has recently gained popularity [HS20, FPP22, BDG24], and we provide a theoretical framework and convergence rates for it. In particular, we show that sample-based approximations to \${\textbackslash}mathbb\{E\}\_\{{\textbackslash}theta\}[X]\$, where \${\textbackslash}theta\$ denotes the model and \${\textbackslash}mathbb\{E\}\_\{{\textbackslash}theta\}\$ the expectation with respect to the distribution \$P\_{\textbackslash}theta\$ of the model \${\textbackslash}theta\$, can be obtained across all \${\textbackslash}theta {\textbackslash}in {\textbackslash}Gamma\$ by minimizing a map \$V:H{\textbackslash}rightarrow {\textbackslash}mathbb\{R\}\$ with \$H\$ a suitable function space. The minimization can be achieved easily by fitting a standard feedforward neural network with stochastic gradient descent. We show that MinMC, which uses only one sample for each model, significantly outperforms a traditional Monte Carlo method performed for multiple values of \${\textbackslash}theta\$, which are subsequently interpolated. Our case study suggests that MinMC might serve as a new benchmark for parameter-dependent Monte Carlo simulations, which appear not only in quantitative finance but also in many other areas of scientific computing.},

We introduce novel algorithms for training fast, accurate pricing and risk approximations, online, in real-time, with convergence guarantees. Our machinery is applicable to arbitrary Derivatives instruments or trading books, under arbitrary stochastic models of the underlying market variables. It effectively resolves computational bottlenecks of Derivatives risk reports and capital calculations. Differential ML is a general extension of supervised learning, where ML models are trained on examples of not only inputs and labels but also differentials of labels wrt inputs. It is also applicable in many situations outside finance, where high quality first-order derivatives wrt training inputs are available. Applications in Physics, for example, may leverage differentials known from first principles to learn function approximations more effectively. In finance, AAD computes pathwise differentials with remarkable efficacy so differential ML algorithms provide extremely effective pricing and risk approximations. We can produce fast analytics in models too complex for closed form solutions, extract the risk factors of complex transactions and trading books, and effectively compute risk management metrics like reports across a large number of scenarios, backtesting and simulation of hedge strategies, or regulations like XVA, CCR, FRTB or SIMM-MVA.

  abstract = {Abstract             In this work we propose a novel backward differential deep learning-based algorithm for solving high-dimensional nonlinear backward stochastic differential equations (BSDEs), where the deep neural network (DNN) models are trained, not only on the inputs and labels, but also on the differentials of the corresponding labels. This is motivated by the fact that differential deep learning can provide an efficient approximation of the labels and their derivatives with respect to inputs. The BSDEs are reformulated as differential deep learning problems by using Malliavin calculus. The Malliavin derivatives of the BSDE solution themselves satisfy another BSDE, resulting thus in a system of BSDEs. Such formulation requires the estimation of the solution, its gradient and the Hessian matrix, represented by the triple of processes \${\textbackslash}left (Y, Z, {\textbackslash}varGamma {\textbackslash}right ).\$ All the integrals within this system are discretized by using the Euler--Maruyama method. Subsequently, DNNs are employed to approximate the triple of these unknown processes. The DNN parameters are backwardly optimized at each time step by minimizing a differential learning type loss function, which is defined as a weighted sum of the dynamics of the discretized BSDE system, with the first term providing the dynamics of the process \$Y\$ and the other the process \$Z\$. An error analysis is carried out to show the convergence of the proposed algorithm. Various numerical experiments of up to \$50\$ dimensions are provided to demonstrate the high efficiency. Both theoretically and numerically, it is demonstrated that our proposed scheme is more efficient in terms of computation time or accuracy compared with other contemporary deep learning-based methodologies.},

The support for a stochastic volatility model including jumps in both prices and volatility is strong and the model clearly outperforms the others in terms of a superior fit to data. Our estimation method allows us to obtain a detailed study of oil prices during two periods of extreme market stress included in our sample; the Gulf war and the recent financial crisis. We also address the economic significance of model choice in two option pricing applications. The implied volatilities generated by the different estimated models are compared and we price a real option to develop an oil field. Our findings indicate that model choice can have a material effect on the option values.},

The rest of this article is structured as follows. The authors describe the dynamics of the LMM and fix notations. They review the basic forward calculations of pathwise Greeks and then describe the fundamental principles of the adjoint method, both for European-style derivatives only. Next, they describe how the usual forward framework can be extended to value Bermudan options: after a forward procedure they need to work backwards to calculate the optimal exercise times. Bermudan swaptions belong to callable Libor exotics and are by far the most prevalent and important type of those.},

  abstract = {We propose machine learning methods for solving fully nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs) with convex Hamiltonian. Our algorithms are conducted in two steps. First, the PDE is rewritten in its dual stochastic control representation form, and the corresponding optimal feedback control is estimated using a neural network. Next, three different methods are presented to approximate the associated value function, i.e., the solution of the initial PDE, on the entire space-time domain of interest. The proposed deep learning algorithms rely on various loss functions obtained either from regression or pathwise versions of the martingale representation and its differential relation, and compute simultaneously the solution and its derivatives. Compared to existing methods, the addition of a differential loss function associated with the gradient, and augmented training sets with Malliavin derivatives of the forward process, yields a better estimation of the PDE's solution derivatives, in particular of the second derivative, which is usually difficult to approximate. Furthermore, we leverage our methods to design algorithms for solving families of PDEs when varying terminal condition (e.g., option payoff in the context of mathematical finance) by means of the class of DeepOnet neural networks aiming to approximate functional operators. Numerical tests illustrate the accuracy of our methods on the resolution of a fully nonlinear PDE associated with the pricing of options with linear market impact, and on the Merton portfolio selection problem.},

After analyzing the method theoretically and by regression examples for different one-dimensional problems, we finally apply the approach to one of the standard problems asset managers and banks are facing: the calibration of spread curves. The presented results clearly show the potential that lies within this method. Furthermore, this application is of particular interest to financial practitioners, since nearly all asset managers and banks which are having solutions in place may need to adapt or even change their current methodologies when ESG ratings additionally affect the bond spreads.},

  abstract = {Differential machine learning (DML) is a recently proposed technique that uses samplewise state derivatives to regularize least square fits to learn conditional expectations of functionals of stochastic processes as functions of state variables. Exploiting the derivative information leads to fewer samples than a vanilla ML approach for the same level of precision. This paper extends the methodology to parametric problems where the processes and functionals also depend on model and contract parameters, respectively. In addition, we propose adaptive parameter sampling to improve relative accuracy when the functionals have different magnitudes for different parameter sets. For calibration, we construct pricing surrogates for calibration instruments and optimize over them globally. We discuss strategies for robust calibration. We demonstrate the usefulness of our methodology on one-factor Cheyette models with benchmark rate volatility specification with an extra stochastic volatility factor on (two-curve) caplet prices at different strikes and maturities, first for parametric pricing, and then by calibrating to a given caplet volatility surface. To allow convenient and efficient simulation of processes and functionals and in particular the corresponding computation of samplewise derivatives, we propose to specify the processes and functionals in a low-code way close to mathematical notation which is then used to generate efficient computation of the functionals and derivatives in TensorFlow.},

We define drivers for asset and portfolio dynamics and their optimal selection. For this framework, we introduce the Commonality Principle, providing a solution for the optimal selection of portfolio drivers as the common drivers. Portfolio constituent dynamics are modeled by Partial Differential Equations, and solutions approximated with neural networks. Sensitivities with respect to the common drivers are obtained via Automatic Adjoint Differentiation. Information on asset dynamics is incorporated via sensitivities into portfolio optimization. Portfolio constituents are embedded into the space of sensitivities with respect to their common drivers, and a distance matrix in this space called the Sensitivity matrix is used to solve the convex optimization for diversification. The sensitivity matrix measures the similarity of the projections of portfolio constituents on a vector space formed by common drivers' returns and is used to optimize for diversification on both idiosyncratic and systematic risks while adding directionality and future behavior information via returns dynamics. For portfolio optimization, we perform hierarchical clustering on the sensitivity matrix. The clustering tree is used for recursive bisection to obtain the weights. To the best of the author's knowledge, this is the first time that sensitivities' dynamics approximated with neural networks have been used for portfolio optimization. Secondly, that hierarchical clustering on a matrix of sensitivities is used to solve the convex optimization problem and incorporate the hierarchical information of these sensitivities. Thirdly, public and listed variables can be used to obtain maximum idiosyncratic and systematic diversification by means of the sensitivity space with respect to optimal portfolio drivers. We reach over-performance in many experiments with respect to all other out-of-sample methods for different markets and real datasets. We also include a recipe for the methodology to increase performance even further, and tackle the main issues in portfolio management such as regimes, non-stationarity, overfitting, and selection bias.},

Additional empirical work shows that jumps in volatility and price level in most cases occur together, are strongly dependent, and have opposite sign.

Thus, our network is an excellent pricing engine for fast gradient-based calibrations. Extensive tests on selected equity markets show that the DDN significantly outperforms non-differential feedforward neural networks in terms of calibration accuracy.
